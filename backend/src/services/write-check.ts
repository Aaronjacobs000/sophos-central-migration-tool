/**
 * What happened to a write Sophos gave no clear answer to.
 *
 * Sophos can answer 500 to a create and still make the object (seen live on
 * the detection profile API, 26/09/2026), so the API client never sends a
 * write twice (sophos-client.ts): it throws UnclearWriteError. The copies
 * then read the destination back, a few times to get past read lag, and
 * report what they find: made, with a note saying how Sophos answered, or not
 * found, saying where the tool looked and what it found there. A miss is not
 * proof, because Sophos can take a while to show a write, so the advice is
 * to wait before trying again, not to check a place the tool already read.
